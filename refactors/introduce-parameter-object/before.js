/* 
Benefits
More readable code. Instead of a hodgepodge of parameters, you see a single object with a comprehensible name.

Identical groups of parameters scattered here and there create their own kind of code duplication: while identical code isnâ€™t being called, identical groups of parameters and arguments are constantly encountered.
