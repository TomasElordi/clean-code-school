## Description

This code smell refers to those large conditional blocks of **10+** `if-else` statements we all have seen. These blocks start out relatively **small then grow** with as new requirements and features are brought in.They are usually a result of a **lack of design planning**.

## Recognition. Signs and Symptoms

As mentioned before this code smell refers to **large blocks of conditionals** so it is fairly easy to detect. Have a look at this example:

```js
const getAnimalEmoji = animal => {
  if (animal === 'dog') {
    return 'üê∂';
  } else if (animal === 'cat') {
    return 'üê±';
  } else if (animal === 'frog') {
    return 'üê∏';
  } else if (animal === 'panda') {
    return 'üêº';
  } else if (animal === 'giraffe') {
    return 'ü¶í';
  } else if (animal === 'monkey') {
    return 'üêµ';
  } else if (animal === 'unicorn') {
    return 'ü¶Ñ';
  } else if (animal === 'dragon') {
    return 'üê≤';
  }
};
```

If we focus on JavaScript more interesting examples can be found in the [`before.js`](./before.js) and [`after.js`](./after.js) files.

## Refactoring

The first thing to do is to **plan before starting a conditional block** or look for an alternative if it is starting to grow. A common solution would be to extract the conditionals into well-named methods with the [Extract Method](https://github.com/guidesmiths/clean-code-school/tree/master/refactors/extract-method).

```js
const getDogEmoji = () => 'üê∂';
const getCatEmoji = () => 'üê±';
const getFrogEmoji = () => 'üê∏';
const getPandaEmoji = () => 'üêº';
const getGiraffeEmoji = () => 'ü¶í';
const getMonkeyEmoji = () => 'üêµ';
const getUnicornEmoji = () => 'ü¶Ñ';
const getDragonEmoji = () => 'üê≤';
```
